# Even and Odd

In this assignment you'll get some practice with slices and for loops.

Here are the directions:

- Create a new project folder to house this new project and create a 'main.go' file inside of it.
- In the main.go file, define a function called 'main'.  Remember that the 'main' function will be called automatically.
- In the main function, create a slice of ints from 0 through 10
- Iterate through the slice with a for loop.  For each element, check to see if the number is even or odd.
- If the value is even, print out "even".  If it is odd, print out "odd"
- Run your code from the terminal by changing into your project directory then running 'go run main.go'.
Your output should look like this:

```
0 is even
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even
5 is odd
6 is even
7 is odd
8 is even
9 is odd
10 is even
```
